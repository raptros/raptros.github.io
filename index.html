        <p>the list i’ve assembled this year is a list of my 15 favorite albums (or other releases) of the year. i think it’s important to make it clear that this is not the same as “what do i think are the best albums of the year”. i would not be comfortable attempting to assemble and defend a list of the “best of the year”, for three key reasons -</p>
<ul>
<li><em>exposure</em>. i have not heard every metal album released this year. i probably haven’t heard even a tenth of the albums released this year. the albums i have added to my collection this year have gone through a hell of a journey to get there - they made it onto the various and dubious blogs i read (or even worse, facebook pages i happen to glance at occasionally), received descriptions that interested me enough to hit play on whatever streams were linked, and reached me in the right mood for me to actually commit to obtaining the album (or EP or whatever). it’s a long and stupid process, and it means i miss out on a lot potentially great releases.</li>
<li><em>current understanding</em> - i.e. what i currently know about the objective evaluation of music in general, and metal in particular, and how this informs what i listen to and how this informs my …</li>
<li><em>personal taste</em>, which is not necessarily related to quality or timelessness or anything beyond sheer personal bias. personal taste is what makes me listen to certain albums over and over, what informs my immediate reaction to anything i hear, and what lets me enjoy all kinds of dumb albums.</li>
</ul>
<p>on the other hand, the task of listing the albums i enjoyed the most in 2014 is only as hard as it is for me to remember what albums (or EPs, or whatever) I enjoyed the most this year.</p>
<p>anyway, now that i’ve thouroughly confused the subject, i just have a few notes on the organization of this list before i get to the meat.</p>
